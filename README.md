You need to run `npm install` separately under two folders: **client** and **server**.

First, deploy the database with the sql file, and then start your mysql (just start wamp is fine).

After that, still run `npm run serve` to start the front-end, but run `node index.js` to start the back-end part.

And you shall see the simplest demo, read the comments to understand how does the api work.
